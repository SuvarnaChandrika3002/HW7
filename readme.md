# Dockerization Project Summary

This document summarizes the key steps, experiences, and challenges faced during the Dockerization process.

## Key Steps
1. Created a Docker Hub account to host container images.  
2. Created a new repository on Docker Hub for the project.  
3. Built the Docker image locally using a Dockerfile.  
4. Tagged the local image with the Docker Hub repository name.  
5. Pushed the Docker image to the Docker Hub repository.  
6. Verified the image availability and tested pulling it on a different machine.  
7. Automated the build and push process using a CI/CD pipeline (optional but recommended).  

## Challenges and Learnings
- Encountered version mismatches between local Docker and the base image, which required updating Docker Desktop.  
- Faced authentication errors during the first push to Docker Hub, resolved by reconfiguring Docker login credentials.  
- Learned the importance of using `.dockerignore` to reduce image size and speed up build times.  
- Gained insights into multi-stage builds to optimize image size and improve security.  
- Understood how to handle environment variables and secrets securely within Docker containers.
